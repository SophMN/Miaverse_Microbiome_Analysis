**Microbiome Data Science with Miaverse**

The soil, air, water and our bodies are colonised by trillions of microorganisms. These microbes form an ecosystem referred to as the microbiome. Microbiomes play a significant role in supporting plant, animal and human health.

**Miaverse**

Miaverse is a modern Bioconductor package used for the analysis of amplicon sequence data (16S rRNA/ITS) and shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Link to the Bioconductor book:

**Goal**

The goal of this project is to determine the impact of feeding patterns on gut microbiome composition using the Miaverse tool. The aim of this learning journey is to enhance my skills in microbiome data science including: machine learning, data manipulation and visualisation.
